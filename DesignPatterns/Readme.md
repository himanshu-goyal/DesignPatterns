Singleton Pattern:
	- Singleton Pattern belongs to Creational type pattern.
	- Singleton design pattern is used when we need to ensure that only one object of a particular class is Instantiated. That single instance created is responsible to coordinate actions across the application. 
	- Advantage: Concurrent access to the resource is well managed by singleton design pattern.
	- private constructor helps in preventing any external instantiations of objects and sealed will prevent the class inheritances.
	- Thread safety: Use lock to make sure only one tread can init the object.
	- Also make sure to check if instance is null or not before trying lock.
	- Late init help us in improving performance.
	- Reduces the memory footprint on start-up.
	- faster application load.
	- Eager loading: pre init of the object and keep it ready.
	- change null to new singleton instance.
	- change instance property to read only.
	- remove the initlization in get instance property. 
	- remove the static object.
	- CLR takes care the init and take care of thread safety.
	- We can make Lazy init by using Lazy keyword.
