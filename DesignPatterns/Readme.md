Singleton Pattern:
	- Singleton Pattern belongs to Creational type pattern.
	- Singleton design pattern is used when we need to ensure that only one object of a particular class is Instantiated. That single instance created is responsible to coordinate actions across the application. 
	- Advantage: Concurrent access to the resource is well managed by singleton design pattern.
	- private constructor helps in preventing any external instantiations of objects and sealed will prevent the class inheritances.
	- Thread safety:
